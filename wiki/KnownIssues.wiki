#summary Known issues in the initial release of the SDK

  * Chromium must be started with --enable-Knnacl to run NaCl modules
  * [http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient-sdk/issues/detail?id=10 10]: Chromium doesnâ€™t respect markup to choose the right architecture binary, so samples will not load if the wrong arch nexe is referenced.  
  * [http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient-sdk/issues/detail?id=11 11]: The ARM code generation path is not working in the SDK yet. 
  * [http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient-sdk/issues/detail?id=12 12]: The SDK provides no facility for debugging at the moment other than printf().  We plan to offer improved debugging support long-term.  
  * [http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient-sdk/issues/detail?id=13 13]: There is no Windows IDE support.
  * Only the low-level NPAPI and Pepper layers are exposed.  We plan to add a higher-level API for convenience.
