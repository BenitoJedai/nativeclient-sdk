#summary Known issues in the initial release of the SDK

Here are the most important issues in the initial release of the SDK:

  * Chromium must be started with --enable-nacl to run Native Client modules
  * Chromium doesnâ€™t respect markup to choose the right architecture binary, so samples will not load if the wrong arch nexe is referenced.  ([http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient-sdk/issues/detail?id=10 10])
  * The ARM code generation path is not working in the SDK yet. ([http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient-sdk/issues/detail?id=11 11])
  * The SDK provides no facility for debugging at the moment other than printf().  We plan to offer improved debugging support long-term.  ([http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient-sdk/issues/detail?id=12 12])
  * There is no Windows IDE support. ([http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient-sdk/issues/detail?id=13 13])
  * Only the low-level NPAPI and Pepper layers are exposed.  We plan to add a higher-level API for convenience.
