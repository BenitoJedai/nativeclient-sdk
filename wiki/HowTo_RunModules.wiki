#summary Detailed instructions for running prebuilt Native Client modules

This page tells you everything you need to know to run a Native Client module that's already been published.

  -------
  <b>Note:</b> If you've already followed HowTo_GetStarted, the information on this page probably looks familiar. This page has more details about how to run modules, with the goal of helping you run examples that are already online.

= Step 1: Get the Dev channel of Google Chrome =

Install a [http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel Dev Channel build] of Google Chrome.

  ------
  <b>Note:</b> Your version of Google Chrome must be at least *6.0.453.1 (revision 51400)* or later.  To find the version number, type `about:version` into the address bar.
  ------

= Step 2: Launch the browser with --enable-nacl =

To run Native Client modules, you must quit Google Chrome and then launch it with the `--enable-nacl` flag.

  ------
  <b>Note:</b> If you don't want to quit Google Chrome, you can use the <a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/creating-and-using-profiles">`--user-data-dir` flag</a>, which sets up a new profile that lets you run two instances of Google Chrome.
  ------

<dl>
<dt> *Windows:* </dt>
<dd> 
<pre>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe --enable-nacl --user-data-dir=%USERPROFILE%\nacl-chrome-profile</pre>
</dd>

<dt> *Mac:* </dt>
<dd> <pre>"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" --enable-nacl --user-data-dir=$HOME/nacl-chrome-profile</pre>
</dd>

<dt> *Linux:* </dt>
<dd> <pre>/opt/google/chrome/chrome --enable-nacl --user-data-dir=$HOME/nacl-chrome-profile</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

To make launching the browser easier, you can set up a platform-specific shortcut or alias.

= Step 3: Run the samples =

To run a Native Client module, you just visit the page that includes it. Here's the URL for a page that includes a few samples:

    [http://naclports.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/gallery/index.html http://naclports.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/gallery/index.html]

Copy that URL into your Native Client-enabled copy of Google Chrome, or click on [http://naclports.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/gallery/index.html this link].

When the page loads, you should see two columns. The left column describes each sample; the right one contains the sample. It should look something like this:

    http://nativeclient-sdk.googlecode.com/svn/data/site/onlineSamples.png

= Troubleshooting =

If you visit the URL from Step 3 and don't see anything in the second column, then you're probably using the wrong browser to visit the URL. Be sure to use a recent version of Google Chrome (see Step 1), start it with --enable-nacl (see Step 2), and use that browser to visit the URL.
