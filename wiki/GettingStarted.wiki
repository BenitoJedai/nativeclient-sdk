<h1>Wait a minute!</h1>

We're revising the SDK and instructions, based on tester feedback. If you can wait to try out the SDK, please check back tomorrow to see whether we've removed this warning.

This page tells you how to use the Native Client SDK to build and run a Native Client module. {PENDING: This page is preliminary. We plan to split it up into one page per platform.}

<wiki:toc />

= Before you start =

A few terminology notes:

  * The term _.nexe_ refers to a publishable, platform-independent executable file for a Native Client module.
  * To debug your Native Client module, you need to make a _development_ version of it, as opposed to a _publishable_ version of it.
  * This page uses _Chromium_ to refer to the most recent browser builds provided by the open-source project behind Google Chrome

A few platform notes:

  * ...

= Getting the software =

To build and run Native Client modules,
you need to get the Native Client SDK
and the right version of the browser.

<ol>
<li> Download the SDK for your platform: 

    [http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/nacl_archive/nacl_new_sdk/naclsdk_win.exe Windows SDK] | [http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/nacl_archive/nacl_new_sdk/naclsdk_mac.tgz Mac SDK] | [http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/nacl_archive/nacl_new_sdk/naclsdk_linux.tgz Linux SDK]

</li>

<li> Extract the SDK's files.

<dl>
<dt> Windows: </dt>
<dd> Run the self-extracting archive:
<blockquote>
<pre>naclsdk_win.exe</pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>

<dt> Mac or Linux: </dt>
<dd> Use the `tar` command:
<blockquote>
<pre>tar xvf naclsdk_mac.tgz</pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>

<p> <b>Important:</b>
Make sure there are *no spaces* in the path to the SDK. For example, the path `C:\Documents and Settings\me\My Documents\nacl-sdk` is bad; you can't successfully build examples under that directory. Instead, you could put the SDK under `C:\nacl-sdk`. 
</p>
</li>

<li> Download and unarchive a Chromium build from http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/. The following builds have been confirmed to work:
  * [http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/win/2010-04-23/45444/chrome-win32.zip 45444] (Windows)
  * [http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/mac/2010-04-23/45445/chrome-mac.zip 45445] (Mac)
  * [http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/linux/2010-04-23/45444/chrome-linux.zip 45444] (Linux; if you have a 64-bit machine, see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ia32-libs/+bug/253430 for help on using a 32-bit browser)
</li>

</ol>

= Running the SDK examples =

Pre-built versions of the examples are under the SDK's `examples/publish` directory. For example, the 32-bit x86 .nexes are in `examples/publish/x86_32`. To run an example in the SDK, you need to do three things:

  # Launch Chromium with the `--enable-nacl` flag
  # Start a web server that can serve the pages under `examples/publish`
  # Visit the example's URL in Chromium

Here are the details.

<ol>
<li>Launch Chromium with the `--enable-nacl` flag. Consider also using the <a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/creating-and-using-profiles">`--user-data-dir` flag</a>, which will protect your normal browser cache from your Native Client development. To launch Chromium with these flags set, either you can run it from a command line or you can set up a platform-specific shortcut or alias.

<dl>
<dt> Windows: </dt>
<dd> 
<pre>chrome-win32\chrome --enable-nacl --user-data-dir=%USERPROFILE%\nacl-chrome-profile</pre>
</dd>

<dt> Mac: </dt>
<dd> <pre>Chromium/Contents/MacOS/Chromium --enable-nacl --user-data-dir=$HOME/nacl-chrome-profile</pre>
</dd>

<dt> Linux: </dt>
<dd> <pre>chromium/chrome --enable-nacl --user-data-dir=$HOME/nacl-chrome-profile</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

</li>

<li>Start a web server that can serve the contents of `publish` in the `examples` directory.  A simple python-based HTTP server is provided with the SDK, in the `examples` directory:<br />
<pre>python httpd.py 5103</pre>
This starts a local server on port 5103.  You can shut this server down by adding a ?quit=1 parameter to the URL.  For example:<pre>http://localhost:5103/?quit=1</pre>
</li>

<li>Visit the URL corresponding to the example you want to run.  If you used the simple HTTP server in the SDK , these URLs have `localhost:5103` as the host. For example to run the hello_world example you would enter this URL in to Chromium:<br />
<pre>http://localhost:5103/publish/x86_32/hello_world.html</pre>
The URLs for the examples, served from the simple SDK server and on a 32-bit x86 computer are:
<ul>
<li>`http://localhost:5103/publish/x86_32/hello_world.html`</li>
<li>`http://localhost:5103/publish/x86_32/pi_generator.html`</li>
<li>`http://localhost:5103/publish/x86_32/tumbler.html`</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ol>
== What to expect ==

=== Hello World ===
  * Look at the *Status* heading. If you see SUCCESS, then the example is working. If not, try reloading the page. If you still don't see SUCCESS — for example, if it says the Client modules are loading too slowly — the example might still be OK.
  * Click the *Call fortytwo()* button. <br /> A dialog should come up, saying that the page says: *42*
  * Click the *Call helloworld()* button. <br /> A dialog should come up, saying that the page says: *hello, world.*

=== Pi Generator ===
  * A text box should appear and start printing values of PI.
  * A partially red square with an inscribed blue quarter-circle should appear.  Black speckles are painted on the square, these represent Monte Carlo points.
  * The example stops by itself after iterating for a while.

=== Tumbler ===
  * A magenta square should appear.  This is the front face of a 3D cube.
  * You can use the mouse to tumble the cube.  Click and drag over the cube and see what happens!

{PENDING: More troubleshooting should go here.}


= What to do next =

  * Try building the examples yourself.  Each one comes with a Makefile, for example to build the Hello World example:<br /><pre>cd hello_world ; make publish</pre>
  * If you're using Mac or Linux, try DebuggingModules
  * See WritingModules

If you're using Google Chrome (not Chromium) and a 64-bit Linux machine:
  * You must use the *32-bit* version of the browser.  To do so, after downloading the <tt>google-chrome-unstable_current_i386.deb</tt> file, you will need to type in
    * <tt>sudo apt-get remove google-chrome-beta # if you have a 64-bit version of chrome installed </tt>
    * <tt>sudo dpkg --force-architecture -i google-chrome-unstable_current_i386.deb</tt>
  * Some Linux computers do not have drivers for hardware-accelerated 3D graphics installed.  These *must* be installed in order for the Tumbler example to work.  To find out if you are using the software renderer, try running `glxinfo` and look for the Mesa driver.  If it is running, then you need to install a driver that does hardware acceleration.
