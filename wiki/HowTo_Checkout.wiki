== Native Client SDK has moved ==

The Native Client SDK itself has moved to the chromium repository. Instructions for building and testing the Native Client SDK itself are located on the [https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/nativeclient/sdk/howto_buildtestsdk chromium.org website]

This repository is still used from some tools and applications that are  ancillary to the SDK itself and don't belong in the chromium repo.

}}}

== Create a .gclient Configuration (svn) ==
