== Native Client SDK has moved ==

The Native Client SDK itself has moved to the chromium repository. Instructions for building and testing the Native Client SDK itself are located in the [https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/native_client_sdk/src/BUILDING.rst chromium repository].

This repository is still used from some tools and applications that are  ancillary to the SDK itself and don't belong in the chromium repo.

== Prerequisites ==

You need to install [http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-depot-tools depot_tools] in order to use gclient.

{{{
mkdir nativeclient-sdk
cd nativeclient-sdk
}}}

=== Create a .gclient Configuration (git) ===
{{{
gclient config --name=src  https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/nativeclient-sdk.git
}}}

=== Create a .gclient Configuration (svn) ===
{{{
gclient config http://nativeclient-sdk.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src
}}}

=== Sync to the repo ===
