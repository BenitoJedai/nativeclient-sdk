== Native Client SDK has moved ==

The Native Client SDK itself has moved to the chromium repository. Instructions for building and testing the Native Client SDK itself are located on the [https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/nativeclient/sdk/howto_buildtestsdk chromium.org website]

This repository is still used from some tools and applications that are  ancillary to the SDK itself and don't belong in the chromium repo.

== Prerequisites ==

You need to install [http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-depot-tools depot_tools] in order to use gclient.

== Checking out [git] ==

To checkout using glient and git use the following commands:

{{{
mkdir nativeclient-sdk
cd nativeclient-sdk
gclient config https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/nativeclient-sdk.git --name=src
gclient sync
}}}
