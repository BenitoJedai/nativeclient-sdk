#summary Detailed instructions for running prebuilt Native Client modules

This page tells you everything you need to know to run a Native Client module that's already been published.

*Note:* If you've already followed GettingStarted, this information should look familiar. The differences: this goes into more detail about how to run modules, and this page points to some precompiled examples that are already online.

= Before you start =

A few terminology notes:

  * The term _.nexe_ refers to a publishable, platform-independent executable file for a Native Client module.
  * This page uses _Chromium_ to refer to the most recent browser builds provided by the open-source project behind Google Chrome

A few platform notes:

  * ...

= Step 1: Get Chromium =

Although you can use the Dev channel of Google Chrome to run .nexes, we recommend using Chromium because Native Client is still a work in progress and hasn't completed security testing. Using a known version of Chromium reduces the chance of Native Client bugs, and it lets you use Google Chrome as your primary browser without worrying about Native Client security.

Here's what we recommend:

<ol>

<li> Download a Chromium build from http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/. The following builds have been confirmed to work:
  * [http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/win/2010-05-14/47357/chrome-win32.zip 47357] (Windows)
  * [http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/mac/2010-05-14/47357/chrome-mac.zip 47357] (Mac)
  * [http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/linux/2010-05-14/47357/chrome-linux.zip 47357] (32-bit Linux)
  * [http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/continuous/linux64/2010-05-14/47357/chrome-linux.zip 47357] (64-bit Linux)
</li>

<li> Unzip Chromium. It doesn't matter too much where you put it, but here are some typical places:

<dl>
<dt> Windows: </dt>
<dd> <code> $!ProgramFiles\chrome-win32
$APPDATA\Chromium\Application
$USERPROFILE\!AppData\Chromium\Application </code>
</dd>

<dt> Mac: </dt>
<dd> <code> /Applications/Chromium.app </code>
</dd>

<dt> Linux: </dt>
<dd> <code> /opt/google/chromium </code>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>

</ol>

= Step 2: Launch the browser with --enable-nacl =

To run .nexes, you must launch the browser with the `--enable-nacl` flag. Consider also using the <a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/creating-and-using-profiles">`--user-data-dir` flag</a>, so you'll have a separate browser cache for Native Client development.

<dl>
<dt> Windows: </dt>
<dd> 
<pre>chrome-win32\chrome --enable-nacl --user-data-dir=%USERPROFILE%\nacl-chrome-profile</pre>
</dd>

<dt> Mac: </dt>
<dd> <pre>Chromium/Contents/MacOS/Chromium --enable-nacl --user-data-dir=$HOME/nacl-chrome-profile</pre>
</dd>

<dt> Linux: </dt>
<dd> <pre>chromium/chrome --enable-nacl --user-data-dir=$HOME/nacl-chrome-profile</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

To make launching the browser easier, you can set up a platform-specific shortcut or alias.

= Step 3: Run the samples =

To run a sample, you just visit the page that contains the sample. Here's the URL for a page that includes a few samples:

    `http://nativeclient-sdk.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/docs/gallery/index.html`

Copy that URL into your Native Client-enabled copy of Chromium.
