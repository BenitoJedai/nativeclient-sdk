#labels Featured

You can give feedback to the Native Client team (and get help) in a couple of ways. The *preferred* way is posting to the public discussion group:

    [http://groups.google.com/group/native-client-discuss native-client-discuss]

If you don't want to post publicly, you can send [mailto:nacl-developer-feedback@google.com private email] to the team.
